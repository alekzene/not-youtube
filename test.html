<button>Apparently, I am an element.</button>
<p>HTML TAG: < button >, < p >, etc.</p>
FIXME: What if I want to print the HTML tag syntax without the quotation marks and spaces?

<h1>Right now, I'm just a bunch of text.</h1>
<h3>I really wanna write a blog!</h3>

<p>Anchor Element: a link to another website</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a>
<a href="https://www.pinterest.com/">My Favorite Website</a>
